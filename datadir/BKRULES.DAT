ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ    Many people are at   first put off by the termRoleplaying, because theythink it refers to actingout the "roles" of a     story or play.  Nothing  could be further from thetruth.  Roleplaying gamesare really just dice     games in which players   consult an endless array of tables to determine   who the winner is.           StarShips and Space- Mice, or S&S for short,  is no exception.  One    player serves as the DM, or DiceMaster, who rolls his own dice behind a    screen and makes up      whatever arbitrary rules he wants.  The other     players are SpaceMice,   who helplessly scurry    about the DM's StarShip, waiting for him to tire  of their wretched        existance.                   While this may not   sound like much fun at   first, there is an under-lying dynamic in that theSpaceMice team physicallyoutnumbers the DM.  The  DM must, therefore, allowthe other players to win,or they'll gang up and   beat the tar out of him. And, though that makes   the "rules" irrelevant,  we still earn a fortune  from selling them, so    without further ado...   The Rules                ÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎÎ    Gameplay in S&S is   quite simple and straightforward.  Before the gamestarts, however, the DM  must spend countless     hours drawing maps of hisStarShip, detailing a    rich variety of alien    monsters, and preparing  an elaborate back story.

To do this, fill in Table 4,   The Character Sheet.  Thestats (STR, INT, DEX, andHITS) are determined by  rolling a 13 sided die,  and adding 7 to the score(notated as 1D13+7).  TheHITS stat is recorded by crossing off the bubbles on the Character Sheet,  and additional Character Sheets are available by  purchasing The SpaceMice Diaries expansion book,  or any of the S&S kits.      Next, each character is given 50 Dollars, the fictional currency of theSpaceMice world.  These  Dollars can be used to   buy Equipment from Table 5, or from the Equipment Catalog sourcebook.

At this point he'll      introduce some alien     monster for the SpaceMiceto fight.  The SpaceMice take turns attacking the aliens, then the aliens  attack them.  Damage froman attack is removed fromthe number of HITS the   character has remaining, and when a character's   HiTS are all gone, that  character is removed fromthe game.                    Now, there are two   types of damage, normal  damage and wounds.  Mark normal damage by shading in the bubbles, and use  large X's to record      wounds.  The difference  is that normal damage canbe healed using Medical  Spray (see Catalog),     while wounds cannot.         To calculate the     amount of damage done by an attack, two rolls are made, one for the normal damage and one for the   wound damage.  Resistanceis then subtracted from  those amounts.  If the   character is weak againstthe attack (instead of   resistant to it), the    weakness is added to the damage amount, but is    never allowed to do more than double the damage.      The initial rolls    that are made depend on  the weapon used, and the character's stats.  For  example, a Wrench does   1D4 of Bash damage and   1D2 of Wounds.  And,     since the Wrench is a    close range weapon, that 1D4 of Bash damage is    augmented by a STR bonus roll (1D1 for 10-19 STR, 1D2 for 20-29, 1D3 for   30-39, 1D4 for 40-49, 1D5for 50-59, etc.)             Since all of the     other weapons listed in  Table 5 are well beyond  the price range of the   average SpaceMouse, they are only covered in the  Advanced rules.  And, as a side note, since so    much interest has been   shown in using the S&S   rules in a modern day    setting, ESR is proud to announce that the ALL NEWConventional Arms source book is now available!
