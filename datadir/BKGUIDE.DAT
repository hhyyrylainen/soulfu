Some areeven bold enough to delveinto the Great Dungeon,  in constant search of    wealth and fame, action  and...  Adventure!           But be warned...     Adventuring is serious   business with monster    populations on the rise  and food reserves still  melting away after the   Long Winter.  Hopefully, this book will teach you the hard-learned tricks  of the trade, and prepareyou against the ever     present dangers that     await, lurk and prowl... In this World...  Of     Adventure!                Basic Equipment             While every newcomer brings along a favorite  Dagger or Short Sword,   many seem to neglect the importance of their own  survival, and carry very little else.  Especially food, which is scarce at best.  So, while water   splashes down in abundantsupply, the enterprising Adventurer must find waysto put food in his belly.    The first and most   obvious way is to simply stock up on Food Rations at the Town Store.  Now, unfortunately, recent    supply shortfalls have   driven prices to incred- ible amounts.  Still,    every wise Adventurer    is cautioned to purchase at least one Food Ration,to prevent starvation in case no other edibles canbe found...  In this     World...  Of Adventure!      Which leads us to thesecond, and most widely  used method of acquiring food.  Hunting.  Many of the same monsters that   plague our lands provide nutritious meat to the   weary Adventurer.  Now,  of course, the barbaric  practice of eating other humanoids must be avoidedat all costs, as should  be avoided the meat of   poisonous mosters like   the Tranch.                  Though spoilage is a problem with meat, the   Hubbin folk have devised a clever method of food  Preservation.  Aside fromkeeping the meat longer, the Hubbins claim that   this process can increaseits nutritional value as well.  Wizards scoff,    "Impossible!", but many  veterans will attest thatanything and more is     possible...  In this     World...  Of Adventure!      After food, the most important pieces of basicequipment are Torches,   which light up even the  darkest Dungeon paths,   and Magical Keys, which  can open locked Doors    and Chests before meltinginto nothingness.  Make  sure at least one of yourparty members has packed and planned ahead, beforesetting out...  Into thisWorld...  Of Adventure!                            Strength in Numbers         While it is certainlypossible to walk alone onthe Adventurer's path,   that path usually ends   quickly and painfully forthose who do.  Therefore,we encourage Adventurers to form small parties forextra protection in theirtravels.  But, since foodmust be shared, larger   groups of six or more    should be avoided.           Avoided for the most part that is.  Many greatmonsters, called Bosses  in the trade, are to be  found in the Dungeon     depths and the myriad of Palaces that dot the     land.  Defeating a Boss  requires the combined    force of several parties,and this coordination is essential if you ever    hope to make a name for  yourself...  In this     World...  Of Adventure!      Parties should also  strive for some degree ofdiversity, since each    party member must rely onthe abilities of the     others.  For example, a  Wizard could magically   Bind a Troll, while      Soldiers or some other   party members finish it  off.  Scattered across   the next few pages, you  will find a description  of the various Adventurerclasses and their skills. Soldier                     Aha!

Wizard                      Another principal    ingredient of any well   rounded party is the old Wizard, whose strength   lies in his versatility. Whose magics can reveal  hidden perils, Open      locked Doors, and allow  passage over the         impassable terrain of    this World...

Unfortunately, The G'nomealso enjoys tinkering on Gonnes and Gronnades and any other dangerous      invention he might think up in this World... Of   Adventure!                Elf                         The Woodland Elf is  a strong addition to any party, having precise aimwith his Bow.

But  more importantly, The Elfis able to Subdue and    Train nearly any monster he finds in this World...Of Adventure!             Mystic                      Relying on his Sword to Parry and Deflect     blows, the Mystic wears  only a simple Robe for   protection.  Luckily, he is able to enhance his   natural abilities even   further with a small set of magical spells, makingthe Mystic one of the    most respected Swordsmen in this World...

He   does have his redeeming  talents, though, being   able to Preserve Food andPick any Lock in this    World...  Of Adventure!
