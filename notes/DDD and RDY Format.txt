Each model file can have several base models
  Use base models when actual shape of object is changing
  Use bone animation when object is bending

Segmented models must use bone structure of base model...
  Fingers in hands should be controlled by main model, not hand model...

SDF_FILE_IS_RDY
  DDD files turn into RDY files on call to UpdateFiles(), On start too...
  Native system format for shorts and ints
  Coordinate shorts turn into floats
  Otherwise, format is exactly the same...  Except for that other stuff...


SDF_FILE_IS_TILE
  TILE prefixed DDD files (like TILEGRS0.DDD) get turned into TIL files, and
  are used for drawing layered, tiled terrain without seams.  Generated after
  RDY file is generated, and use same triangle stripping as RDY...


Export RDY file as DDD...  Highest detail level...  For modeler...
  Reimport for SDF Save...


Flag for static or dynamic detail level in game...
  Dynamic should be partwise...
  NOT A FLAG!!!  Do a gradualness slider...  Affects distance for each level...
